To Do List App - AngularJS

This is a simple to-do list app that I created using AngularJS. The live site can be found at http://list.talhawmalik.com/

The to do app has two main features: the to-do list (which is created through AngularJS input form and ng-repeat) and the timer (done through vanillaJS). Feel free to inspect the code - all script and style tags are in that one document.
